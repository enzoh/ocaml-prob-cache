suppose market goes up up then down

P(U U D) is joint distribution

could ask


P(D | U U )

equal to


N(u u d) / sum_{d'} N(u u d')


If we represent items as sets, then we can treat a collection as a set of events that occur simultaneously (order independent and an event can occcur only once).
This is very similar to traditional probability theory.

If we represent items as lists, then we can treat a collection as a *sequence* of events, and now P(A B) != P (B A). 

Both models can map arbitrarily complex types as long as they have a notion of equality or comparison.

OCaml Probability Cache Library
  
## Introduction ##

This library provides a polymorphic cache for maintaining random events to their observed probabilities and expectations. There are two types of supported probability models- a set model and asequence model, either of which can be used in process (with [containers](https://github.com/c-cube/containers)) or over a distributed riak cache (with [riakc_ppx](https://github.com/struktured/riakc_ppx)).
